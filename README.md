# Codveda Data Analytics Project
End-to-end data analytics project using Python, Power BI, and advanced statistical techniques to perform data cleaning, exploratory analysis, predictive modeling, clustering, time series analysis, and NLP sentiment analysis.

# Project Overview
This project showcases an end-to-end data analytics workflow across multiple datasets, covering tasks from raw data cleaning to interactive dashboards and predictive modeling.
The datasets include numerical, categorical, and text-based data, which required comprehensive preprocessing, exploratory analysis, visualization, and modeling. The project demonstrates practical applications of Python, statistical methods, machine learning, and business intelligence tools to extract actionable insights.

# Objectives
1. Load and clean raw datasets with missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent formats.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends, patterns, and correlations.
3. Visualize numerical and categorical relationships through plots and dashboards.
4. Implement predictive models (regression and classification) to forecast outcomes.
5. Apply time series analysis to detect trends and seasonal patterns.
6. Group similar observations using clustering algorithms (K-Means).
7. Perform sentiment analysis on textual data using NLP techniques.
8. Build interactive dashboards to summarize insights for business or operational decision-making.

# Datasets Used
1. House Prediction Dataset – numeric dataset used for regression, EDA, and visualization.
2. Stock Prices Dataset – time-series data used for trend analysis, moving averages, and clustering.
3. Churn Dataset – categorical and numeric data used for predictive modeling and KPI dashboards.
4. Sentiment Dataset – text data used for NLP and sentiment classification.
5. Iris Dataset – simple dataset used for demonstration of basic data cleaning and EDA tasks.

All datasets have been cleaned and preprocessed, with final versions saved for analysis.
